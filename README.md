## [Action Manifest](https://developers.google.com/actions/develop/sdk/actions) (action.json)

```
{
    "versionLabel": "1.0.0",
    "agentInfo": {
        "languageCode": "en-US",
        "projectId": "my first action",
        "voiceName": "female_2"
    },
    "actions": [{
        "initialTrigger": {
            "intent": "assistant.intent.action.MAIN"
        },
        "httpExecution": {
            "url": "<PUBLIC URL GENERATED BY NGROK>"
        }
    }]
}
```

**NOTE:** if you're deploying your action on Google Cloud, use your Google Cloud Project ID instead of "my first action".

## Package.json

In the `package.json`, we provide you with the following (handy) scripts: 

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "start": "nodemon index.js",
        "ngrok": "ngrok http 8080",
        "simulator": "gactions simulate",
        "build": "babel lib -d dist",
        "build:w": "npm run build -- -w",
        "preview": "gactions --verbose preview --action_package action.json --invocation_name 'my first action' --preview_mins 1234",
        "simulator": "gactions simulate",
        "deploy": "npm run build && npm version patch && git push --tags && git push && npm publish"
    }
}
```

**NOTE:** The default port used by GAS is `8080`. See [API section](https://github.com/manekinekko/google-actions-server#actionserverport--8080).

Tools bunlded by GAS for devs needs:

1. [gactions](https://developers.google.com/actions/tools/gactions-cli): is the command line interface that you use to preview, simulate, and publish an action package.
1. [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon): Monitor for any changes in your node.js application and automatically restart the server.
2. [ngrok](https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok): Introspected tunnels to localhost. Allows Google's server to access your local action (while in dev mode)

# Step by Step

0. run `npm install` to install deps
1. run `npm run ngrok`, and copy the HTTPS generated URL,
2. update `httpExecution.url` in `actions.json` with this URL,
3. run `npm run preview`, and **follow the instructions on the terminal**,
4. run `npm start`
5. run `npm run simulator` to start the simulator in CLI mode (or use Google Home)
6. type in `talk to my first action` or `start my first action`

**HINT:** you can run `npm run build:w` in order to watch and rebuild your files on the fly.

**HINT:** I you have a Google Home device, you can use it instead of using the simulator.

**NOTE:** If you already have a server where you can host your Node.js project, you can use your own URL in `httpExecution.url` and skip steps 1 and 2.
